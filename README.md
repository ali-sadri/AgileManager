# agileManager
Nov 12, 2017:

This project is the back-end component of an Agile Manager restful web appliation. It uses the Spring framework/hibernate and currently  configured to use MySql for persistence. (refer to 'resources/application.properties' for DB info).

I have pushed the whole code base so that the APIs can be tried after downloading the project. 
The easiest way to call APIs is to import the project in Inellij Idea (ultimate version that supports Spring and hibernate out of the box)
and run the application. (It can be used in other environments of course by including required libraries in your build process)

This project is 'work in progress' and what is pushed in so far is only the start.
There will be unit testing (for at least all the controller classes). 
Logging and using AspectJ is also something that I will add as I find it is needed for some actions.
Also handling API messages that are currently plain text in the code. And so many other changes of course.

There will be an API description document to be pushed as well.

At some point I am hoping to build a front end and real application out of this :)

I will update this readme document as I progress.

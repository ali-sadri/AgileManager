# agileManager
Nov 12, 2017:
This project is the back-end component of an Agile Manager project. It uses the Spring framework/hibernate and it is configured for
persistance for a MySql database. (refer to 'resources/application.properties' for DB info). 
I have pushed the whole code base so that the APIs can be tried after downloading the project. 
The easiest way to call APIs is to import the project in Inellij Idea (ultimate version that supports Spring and hibernate out of the box)
and run the application. 
This project is a 'work in progress' and what is pushed in so far is only the start.
There will be unit testing (for at least all the controller classed) to be pushed later. 
Also handling API messages that are currently plain text in the code. 
There will be an API description document to be pushed as well.
And of course the front end component that will be written and pushed in future.
I will update this readme document as I progress.
